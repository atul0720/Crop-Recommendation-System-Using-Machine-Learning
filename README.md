# Crop-Recommendation-System-Using-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning-based multi-class classification system that predicts the most suitable crop using soil metrics (N, P, K, pH). The project includes EDA, feature engineering, model comparison, and feature importance analysis to support data-driven agricultural decisions and improve crop yield through AI-powered recommendations.
